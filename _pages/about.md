Hey! I'm Mikulex :)

I'm a programmer, and began programming when I was in 7th grade. Most experience and confidence lie in *Java*, but I've also written scripts in *Python*. I'm interested in learning *Ruby* more too, because I liked working on a Project with *Ruby on Rails*.
I'm also trying to improve my *HTML/CSS/JS* a bit, this site shouldn't look completely horrible after all :)

As for other hobbies, I'm also practicing some art. I use [Krita](https://krita.org/), an open source and nice to work with art program to create digital artworks. If you are curious enough, you can check out my Twitter on my [Contact](/contact.html) page to check a few pieces out, albeit I'm still pretty much a beginner.
