title: My New Blog Site
---

Hello! 

I've been wanting to make some kind of blog for a while, even when I'm not sure what even to write about. The concept of having some kind of blog seemed interesting. Well, now I'm here.

Another reason for wanting to start a blog was because I wanted some project to work on. Popular advice is always "*Look for problems you want to solve!*" or "*Find something you want to automate!*", but I struggle with coming up with something that I wanted to automate and I often don't have some *interesting* problem that went beyond being simple Python or Ruby scripts.

There are project ideas flying around on the internet like writing your own todo app, or a website that shows you the weather. I won't deny that those are great things to write for beginners from a technical standpoint, but if I'm trying to work on a hobby project, I lose interest if it's something I don't end up using myself.

Exercises like on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) are nice for practicing, but what I really missed was some a project that went beyond being a simple script in a single file, but not too large that it would feel like it would overwhelm me.

Starting a blog seemed attractive and brought me to the idea to write my own static site generator. I first thought that I'd maybe just use something like *Hugo* or *Jekyll*, but writing an *SSG* yourself looked like a project that I could tackle.

Practicing some HTML and CSS is a neat side effect too.

With an actual goal finally in my head, I've started on working on [CoffeeTime](https://github.com/mikulex/coffeetime). It is definitely not finished, written and working pretty janky, but at least it works for now I guess. 
It's written in *Java* because that's one of the languages I've been using the most (next to Python and a little bit of Ruby). Not sure if it's the best choice, but I feel most comfortable with it. I'll probably make another post about it when I feel like it.

As for this blog, I think that I won't have any kind of specific thing I want to focus on. I'll write about other projects that I start (if I find any after or next to *CoffeeTime*), or other personal interests that I have at the time that can get beyond technology.
